## Record Scratch ## *record scratch* *freeze frame* "Yep, that's my blockfolio. You're probably wondering how I got myself in this situation."

## Introduction ## "Hi, my name is Ember and I'm here to introduce you to ARK, the exciting new approach for a brighter future of crypto currencies. Today we'll talk about the blockchain and the novel way of establishing transaction consensus without wasting energy and what it means to you - user and investor. This will be the first in a series of videos about how Ark's ecosystem works.
To start off, I'd like to disclose that ARK is currently a major holding of my cryptocurrency investment portfolio and my largest investment next to Bitcoin. ARK maintains its blockchain and mints new coins using a delegated proof of stake protocol with only a limited number of actively forging nodes. The delegates whose nodes make it into top 51 get voted in by people holding ARK whilst their wallet balances determine their stake, or weight that counts towards their chosen delegate's total. This systems ensures that Ark's ecosystem is democratically governed, very efficient in comparison to other cryptocurrencies while still remaining resilient. Currently, Ark is aimed at making digital money more accessible and understable to those still unfamiliar with crypto currencies.

## Comparison to Other Coins ## Since 2008, Bitcoin has revolutionised the way money and value is transacted by removing the need of a third trusted party in completing transactions. ARK has improved upon this platform in a number of areas which I will explain ahead. First and foremost, ARK has streamlined the way in which value can be transferred by utilising a super quick 8 second transfer time, meaning that you can transfer large or small amounts of wealth almost instantly. In comparison, Bitcoin requires about 10 minutes to execute and confirm a transaction which makes it impractical for everyday micro and macro-transactions. Through the implementation of SmartBridges, ARK is even capable of transferring value between alternative cryptocurrencies through its user-friendly wallet and smart contract-based applications through a solution developed by the ARK community, a solution called ACES or Ark Contract Execution Services. This makes ARK the first cryptocurrency to ever utilise cross-blockchain communication.

## PoW vs PoS vs DPoS ## Proof-of-Work, the scheme used by Bitcoin, is inefficient due to the vast amounts of capital and energy required. ARK  however is energy effecient and only requires its top 51 delegates to run a single application on a computer. This means that to run and maintain the entire blockchain, less resources are consumed in a day than any other crypto currency. This is both good for the environment and economical for both the investors and the community, which makes ARK a more sustainable currency and efficient method of transferring wealth whilst still preserving resiliance against service outages and coordinated attacks by malicious parties.

## Why DPoS is great ## As opposed to traditional competition among nodes through computing speed and power, ARK delegate operators compete for votes, whereas top 51 receive 422 ARK a day as a reward for maintaining the ARK blockchain â€“ 2 ARK per block. This reward is often then shared with the delegates voters, meaning that a delegate's merit is based on how generous or likable they are to voters in order to attract and retain their votes, therefore it is a pure form of economic democracy. Most delegates are offering between 80-90% profit sharing of the 422 Ark received DAILY. Unlike bank accounts that offer below inflation percentages, ARK allows you to stake your money to earn up to 10% in interest a year just by holding it and voting for one of the community-run delegates. For more information on earning money with ARK, just click this link right here. I'm currently voting for biz_classic, personally. Because ARK is so community focused, delegate nodes offer incentives to vote for them, and voting for them allows the community to continue to grow. Attributable to this growth, ARK started at a single cent at the end of 2016 during it's initial coin offering, and recently hit an all time high of $4.57.
 
## ARK's Future ## ARK has a diverse community and development team, many of whom have dedicated the last few years of their lives to this project. Unlike the current trend of currencies crowdfunding projects that never eventuate, ARK has constructed a number of high quality products with much more in the pipeline. It has also established a fruitful community that aids in development and offers new ideas. The public roadmap illustrates ARK's vision and progression in completing the goals they have set ahead for themselves. The link to the roadmap can be found in the description below, or by clicking the annotation just here (Point to top right, hold anotation for 3-4 seconds). We would like to point out key technological differentiators that set ARK apart:
-	ARKVM, the coming distributed virtual machine that will enable the execution of smart contracts; what sets it apart from Ethereum's implementation is the ability to utilize off-blockchain data sources, namely Interplanetary File System and Interplanetary Database
-	Think of IPFS as sort of distributed cloud storage of files in any format that can be accessed and used whenever and wherever, without having a possible single point of failure
-	Think of IPDB as a distributed database used for storing structured data inside tables, also accessible from whenever and wherever, again without having a single point of failure
-	Push button deployable blockchains which enable anyone to instantly create a token based on ARK and essentially copy the entirety of ARK's capabilities onto their own crypto currency without having to worry about security, implementation and other technical stuff

The team is active on a wide variety of social media platforms, including facebook, reddit, twitter, instagram, and if potential investors are interested, they can get in contact with the developers directly on Slack. I'll leave links in the description. Thanks for joining me, and I hope to see you again. Stay DELUDED ARKIES  :^)
